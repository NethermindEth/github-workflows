# GitHub Workflows

This repository contains reusable GitHub Actions workflows for Nethermind projects.

The workflows follow a simple name convention:
- technology-action-flavor.yaml

For example:
- docker-build-push-dockerhub.yaml.  Docker is the technology, build-push is the action, dockerhub is the flavor.
